Yet Another Kernel and Userland - A hobby OS written as a school project


## Citing
* ### In programming it's very difficult to write every code section yourself and of course we didn't do that either. <br> That's why we try to cite every source used / everything were we used a source in the making / everything that's someone elses idea
* ### Code that is so common/known that it's common knowledge or code that we created by ourselfs is not cited of course
* ### We cite in the following format:
  * #### /* <br>this snippet was copied */* copied and adapted from:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*or*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the idea to this snippet is from:<br>author; name; https://url.com, date *(German formatting)*<br>*/
  * If it stands at the beginning of a file (with a free line to the code below than the cited source is for the whole code of the file
  * If it stands directly over a function / line of code the cited source is for that function / code
* ### In general we learned how to create a OS and how it works -> meaning the way to program it and with that everything from the kernel from: <br> multiple, OSDev.org; https://wiki.osdev.org/, 18.07.2021
